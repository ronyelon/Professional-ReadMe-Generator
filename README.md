  ### Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

  You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

  ### Installation
  Node.js installation is required prior to use. Download the Inquirer package. 
  The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js

  ### Usage
  When node index.js is run the application uses the inquirer package to provide a set of prompts in the command line with a series of questions about your Github and about your  Github project. Answer the prompted questions and click enter to move to the next question. Once you have answered all the questions a markdown page will be generated.
